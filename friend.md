# 🔧 Understanding friend (keyword) in C++

In **C++**, the keyword **`friend`** is used to allow certain functions or classes to access the private and protected members of another class. Normally, private and protected members of a class are only accessible from within that class’s own member functions (and its derived classes, for protected). By declaring a function or another class as a `friend`, you explicitly allow it to access these members.

## 🔗 Types of Friends

1. **Friend Function:**  
   A non-member function or even a member function of another class can be declared as a friend inside a class. This gives the function direct access to private and protected members of the class.

2. **Friend Class:**  
   You can declare an entire class as a friend. All member functions of the friend class will then have access to the private and protected members of the class where the friendship is declared.

## 🧪 Syntax

###  Friend Function
```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int data;
public:
    friend void showData(const MyClass& obj); // Declaration
};

// Definition of the friend function
void showData(const MyClass& obj) {
    std::cout << obj.data << std::endl; // Direct access to private member
}
```

### Friend Class
```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int data;
public:
    friend class AnotherClass; // Declaration
};

class AnotherClass {
public:
    void display(const MyClass& obj) {
        std::cout << obj.data << std::endl; // Direct access to private member
    }
};
```

## 🔑 Key Points

- Friendship is **not mutual**: If Class A is a friend of Class B, Class B does **not** automatically become a friend of Class A.
- Friendship is **not inherited**: Derived classes do **not** inherit the friendship status.
- Friend functions and classes **do not belong** to the class where they are declared as friends.
- They can access private and protected members of the class where they are declared as friends.
- Use `friend` carefully, as it breaks encapsulation by exposing private data.

# 🧠 **Friend keyword with Analogy**

Think of a **class** as a *house* with locked rooms (private data). Normally, only the *owner* (the class’s own methods) can enter these rooms. However, you can declare someone as a **friend**—maybe your best friend or a trusted neighbor—who is allowed to enter these locked rooms even though they aren’t the owner.

## 🏠 **Types of Friends in C++**

1. **Friend Function:**  
   A non-member function or a member of another class can be given access to private/protected data by declaring it as a friend.

2. **Friend Class:**  
   All member functions of another class can be given access to your private/protected data.

## 🧪 **Syntax Examples**

### 1. **Friend Function**

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int secret;

public:
    MyClass() : secret(42) {}
    friend void revealSecret(const MyClass& obj); // Declare as friend
};

void revealSecret(const MyClass& obj) {
    std::cout << "Secret is: " << obj.secret << std::endl;
}
```
**Here:**  
- `revealSecret` is not a member of `MyClass`, but it can access `secret` because it's a friend.

---

### 2. **Friend Class**

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int secret;

    friend class FriendClass; // All members of FriendClass are friends
};

class FriendClass {
public:
    void showSecret(const MyClass& obj) {
        std::cout << "Secret: " << obj.secret << std::endl;
    }
};
```
**Here:**  
- All methods of `FriendClass` can access private members of `MyClass`.

---

## 🔑 **Key Points**

- Use `friend` sparingly; it breaks encapsulation (the "locked room" rule).
- Friendship is **not mutual** or **inherited**: If Class A is a friend of Class B, Class B doesn’t automatically become a friend of Class A, nor do derived classes inherit friendship.
- Good for operator overloading and when external functions need access to internals.
